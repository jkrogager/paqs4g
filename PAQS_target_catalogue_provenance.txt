4MOST surveys: target-catalogue provenance
==========================================

Justification: It is anticipated that multiple versions of target
catalogues for the same 4MOST survey and sub survey will be uploaded
to 4FS. This is inevitable as surveys refine their target-selection
approaches and success criteria to ensure the delivery of successful
survey programs. To be able to understand the differences between the
various uploaded catalogues it is necessary to capture key information
for each uploaded catalogue.

Please fill out this document and answer the subsequent questions to
provide clear information on the provenance of the uploaded target
catalogue. Note a survey should submit a single document that describes
all of the sub surveys, separately addressing all questions for each
sub survey.

Your answers can include a reference to a paper or any other easily
accessible document or alternatively to provide a link. However, it is
critical that the description is applicable to the specific uploaded
catalogue: a link to a target-catalogue description that can change
and evolve over time is not suitable â€“ it should remain static to
represent the details of the uploaded catalogue. In addition you will
also need to upload your target-selection code and, consequently,
information on the specific target-selection criteria is not required
in this document.

Please provide directly below the title of your survey along with a
list of all associated sub surveys; i.e., please list each sub-survey
number/name along with a very brief description of the sub survey.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What images and catalogues are used to construct the target catalogue?
Include image and catalogue version numbers when appropriate.

All data are taken from Gaia DR3.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
How are the target coordinates determined (e.g., central pixel,
brightest pixel, etc)?

Following the Gaia DR3 catalog.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
How is the target photometry measured?

Following the Gaia DR3 catalog.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
How are target photometric redshifts and associated uncertainties
estimated (if relevant)?

N/A

------------------------------------------------------------------------
How is the foreground reddening towards the target calculated?

Using the maps by Schlafly & Finkbeiner (2011)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What approach and assumptions are made for the selection of the target
spectral templates?

Since our survey is rather agnostic in terms of sample selection, our targets
span a broad range of different object types. We have therefore generated a
large library of spectral templates in order to probe the full range of spectral
shapes that we expect based on a model of quasar properties:
redshift distribution (from Palanque-Delabrouille et al. 2016), intrinsic dust reddening,
and BALs) as well as expected stellar contamination (following Heintz et al. 2020).
The distribution of spectral shapes matches broadly the range of observed colors
(Gaia Blue-Red) of our candidates. All templates are assigned randomly using a
probabilistic approach.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Is the same target included more than once in the sub-survey catalogue
but with a different spectral template and/or ruleset? If yes then
please provide a brief justification.

No


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Any additional critical notes:

Sources have been selected based on three cuts:
 - PM/PM_err < 2
 - PLX/PLX_err < 3
 - G < 20.5 mag
Where PM = proper motion and PLX = parallax. All data are taken from Gaia EDR3.

We have further excluded regions with very high target density as these are caused
by foreground dwarf galaxies with resolved stars. These are excluded by rejecting
healpix pixels with a target density larger than 4*sigma above the median, where
sigma is estimated using the robust median absolute deviation (sigma = 2.5*MAD).
We also reject incomplete healpix pixels along the edge of the footprint where the
target density drops below the median by 2-sigma.
